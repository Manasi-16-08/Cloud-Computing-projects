# Cloud Computing Projects

This repository contains a set of practical **Cloud Computing assignments and lab exercises** completed as part of coursework or personal learning. The assignments focus on real‑world cloud technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins), and other relevant cloud tools and practices.

## Overview

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Projects in this repository demonstrate core cloud computing concepts, containerization, orchestration, continuous integration, and deployment workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This repository includes:
- Docker assignments  
- Kubernetes lab exercises  
- Jenkins CI/CD lab setup  
- Task‑based cloud computing exercises  
- Documentation of assignments in PDF formats  

---

## Features

- Containerization using Docker  
- Orchestration with Kubernetes  
- Jenkins pipeline and automation labs  
- Cloud‑oriented task implementations  
- Structured lab manuals and reports
